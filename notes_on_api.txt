Operations seperate the queriable components of the lush website

All api calls are made through the api gateway: https://www.lush.com/api/gateway

It is additionally possible to gather collections from the json files
https://www.lush.com/_next/data/production-df895fb0/us/en_us/c/charity-pot-collection.json?channel=us&language=en_us&slug=charity-pot-collection

Channel is the country
The language is the language of the country
Slug will be the collection name

This will return an id that can be used to query items in the api
operationName: Product Details
The ids are encoded using base64
                    b64 decode
"UHJvZHVjdDoyOTY5" ------------> "Product:2969"

Means that we can iterate over each product (from 1 to the end)
Can be used to give products ids in the sqlite3 table



Can get root collections span using 

operatorName:Menu
name: commerce_web-uk-suggestions (adjust for country)
languageCode: Country
